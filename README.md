## What is ROS?

ROS is an open-source, meta-operating system for your robot. It provides the services you would expect from an operating system, including hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly-used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management...

## goals of the ROS framework:

- Thin: ROS is designed to be as thin as possible -- we won't wrap your main() -- so that code written for ROS can be used with other robot software frameworks. A corollary to this is that ROS is easy to integrate with other robot software frameworks.
- ROS-agnostic libraries: the preferred development model is to write ROS-agnostic libraries with clean functional interfaces.
- Language independence: the ROS framework is easy to implement in any modern programming language. We have already implemented it in Python, C++, and Lisp.
- Easy testing: ROS has a builtin unit/integration test framework called rostest that makes it easy to bring up and tear down test fixtures.
- Scaling: ROS is appropriate for large runtime systems and for large development processes.
